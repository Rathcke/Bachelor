\section{Conclusions and future work}

\subsection{Current status and plan for the rest of the project}

At this point in the project, we have described and implemented a reasonably
fast distance metric, which might be able to compete with other existing
solutions, e.g. \texttt{UCLUST}, depending on the clustering algorithm used
with the distance metric. There is still room for improvement, however, for
instance we plan to implement storage of $k$-mer frequency vectors together
with the centroids such that these can be reused in subsequent similarity
calculations.

Additionally, there can be made more checks for the possibility of stopping a
comparison early, if it is already known that it will fail.

While the distance metric implementation can be improved we also need to keep
it sensitive. Changing the distance metrics to improve speed could mean a
drawback for its sensibility. We also plan to investigate alternative methods
to locate centroid candidates as the current implementation does not provide
good results.
