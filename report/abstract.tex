  This thesis presents an efficient, greedy, heuristic algorithm for clustering
  huge amounts of DNA/RNA sequences, along with an open-source implementation
  of the algorithm.

  The clustering algorithm utilizes $k$-mers to determine if two sequences are
  likely to belong in the same cluster. To verify two sequences belong to the
  same cluster, a $k$-mer based similarity metric is used as an approximation
  for sequence similarity.  This reduces the time complexity of the
  comparison to linear in the length of the longest of two sequences, instead
  of the more common quadratic running time for sequence alignment, which is
  among others, used in the proprietary \texttt{USEARCH} program.

  The implemented program, \texttt{klust}, has been tested and evaluated on
  both synthetic sequence data based on real data, and on real world data
  consisting of more than 3 million sequences with an average length of over
  \num{1000} nucleotides each.

  The program behaves completely as expected on the synthetic dataset and it
  produces high quality clustering results on real data.

  The program has been shown to run faster, use less memory and produce fewer
  clusters than \texttt{USEARCH}.
