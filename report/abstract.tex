  This thesis presents an efficient, greedy, heuristic algorithm for clustering
  huge amounts of DNA/RNA sequences, along with an open-source implementation
  of the algorithm.

  The clustering algorithm utilizes $k$-mers to determine if two sequences are
  likely to belong in the same cluster. To verify that two sequences belong in
  the same cluster, a $k$-mer based similarity metric is used as an
  approximation for sequence similarity.  This reduces the time complexity of
  the comparison to linear in the length of the longest of the two sequences,
  instead of the more common quadratic running time for sequence alignment,
  which is among others, used in the proprietary \texttt{USEARCH} program.

  The implemented program, \texttt{klust}, has been tested and evaluated on
  both synthetic sequence data based on real data, and on real world data
  consisting of more than 3 million sequences with an average length of over
  \num{1000} nucleotides.

  The program behaves completely as expected on the synthetic dataset and it
  produces high quality clustering results on real data.

  The program has been shown to run faster and produce fewer clusters than
  \texttt{USEARCH} while keeping memory usage low.
