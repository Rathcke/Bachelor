  This paper presents an efficient, greedy, heuristic algorithm for clustering
  huge amounts of DNA/RNA sequences, along with an open-source implementation
  of the algorithm.

  This clustering algorithm utilizes $k$-mers for approximating the likelihood
  that two sequences will be above some given similarity threshold.
  Additionally, a $k$-mer based similarity metric is used for approximating
  sequence similarity and thereby reducing the time complexity of the sequence
  comparison to linear in the length of the longest of two sequences, instead
  of the more common quadratic running time for sequence alignment, which is
  among others used in the proprietary \texttt{USEARCH} program.

  The implemented program, \texttt{klust}, has been tested and evaluated on
  both synthetic sequence data based on real data and on real world data
  consisting of more than 3 million sequences with an average length of over
  1000 nucleotides each.

  The program behaves as expected on the synthetic dataset and it seems to give
  high quality clustering results on real data based on visualizations of
  multidimensional scaling of the sequences.

  The program has been shown to run faster, use less memory and produce fewer
  clusters than \texttt{USEARCH}.
